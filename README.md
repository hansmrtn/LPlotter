# **LPlotter**
This simple Python program displays various plots for Langmuir data captured by the UW-APL.
By default, LPlotter displays a density plot.

## How to Use: 
**LPlotter requires Python 3+** 

To use, copy the Langmuir data that is to be plotted in a new folder with an approriate name under the data/ directory.
The name of the corresponding folder containing the txt/csv langmuir data will title the legend, respectively. 

**To run:**
1) Delete the placeHolder folder. This is here as a simple example.
2) Copy the folders of data that are to be plotted into the data/ directory with appropriate and concise titles. 
3) Execute run.py:
  * All operating systems:
    * In the command line, change the current working directory to ~/LPlotter
    * `python run.py`
  * Or on Windows:
    * Double click run.bat, and ignore the security warning.
